# ✨ Super TIC TAC TOE Games Collection README\! 🎮

This project is a bunch of fun and different **Tic-Tac-Toe** games, all built using the same core C++ code rules. Think of it as a whole arcade of X's and O's\! 🤩

-----

## ⚙️ How the Code Works

  * **Main Rules File** (`BoardGame_Classes.h`) 📜: This file holds the basic blueprints for *all* the games, like how a board and a player should work.
  * **Game Starter** (`XO_Demo.cpp`) 🕹️: This is the file you run\! It shows a menu so you can pick which game you want to play.
  * **Game Files** (`*.h` and `*.cpp` files) 🧩: These files contain the special rules for each unique game.

## 🎲 The Games You Can Play

### Classic Twist Games (3x3 Boards)

1.  **Misere** 😔: The **opposite** game\! If you get 3-in-a-row, you **lose**. Be careful\!
2.  **Numerical** 🔢: Player 1 uses **odd numbers** (1, 3, 5, etc.), Player 2 uses **even numbers** (2, 4, 6, etc.). Win by making a line that **adds up to 15**.
3.  **Infinity** ♾️: The game never fills up\! Every few turns, the **oldest piece on the board disappears**.
4.  **Memory** 🧠: The marks are **hidden** (`-`). You must remember where you and your opponent played to win.
5.  **Word** 💬: You place **letters**. Win by being the first to spell a valid **3-letter word** (needs a `dic.txt` file).
6.  **SUS** 🤫: Score points by making the letters **S-U-S** in a line. The player with the most "SUS" sequences wins.

### Big Board Challenges

1.  **Ultimate** 🤯: This is **9 Tic-Tac-Toe games** played at once\! You win the small boards to win the big game.
2.  **Five XO** 5️⃣: A **5x5 board**. You keep playing until the board is almost full. The winner is the player with the most 3-in-a-row **points**.
3.  **Four in a Row** 👇: Like **Connect Four**. Drop your piece into the column and try to get **four in a row**.
4.  **Obstacles** 🚧: A **6x6 board** with some spots **blocked** (`#`). You need **five in a row** to win.
5.  **Diamond** 💎: A large board, but you can only play in the **diamond shape** in the middle. The winning rules are complex\!

### Unique Shape Games

1.  **Pyramid** 🔺: The board is shaped like a **pyramid**. Win by getting 3-in-a-row along its special paths.
2.  **Four XO (Moving)** 👣: A **4x4 board**. After the start, you move one of your pieces one step to an empty spot to try and get 3-in-a-row.
